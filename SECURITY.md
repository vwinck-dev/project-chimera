## Reporting a Vulnerability

Include a clear description of the issue, steps to reproduce it, and any relevant screenshots or logs. We aim to respond to all security reports within **5 business days**.

Once a report is verified, we will acknowledge receipt, provide updates during the remediation process, and inform you when a fix is released. If the report does not qualify as a security issue, we will explain why.

We highly encourage responsible disclosure and appreciate your help in keeping this project secure.
