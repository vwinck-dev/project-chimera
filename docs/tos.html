  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> November 10, 2025</p>

  <p>
    These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the

    and its associated services.
    By using Chimera, you agree to comply with these Terms and all applicable Discord policies.
  </p>

  <h2>Official Gateway</h2>

      https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1437449931504746580
    </a>
  </p>
  <p>
    Any other bot claiming to be “Chimera” or using the same name outside this link is
    <strong>unauthorized and unofficial</strong>. Use of unofficial instances may result in
    data exposure, instability, or malicious behavior.
  </p>

  <h2>Open Source License</h2>

  </p>
  <p>
    However, you may <strong>not represent unofficial builds</strong> as the “official” Chimera bot.
    The name and branding “Project Chimera” are reserved for the official public instance.
  </p>

  <h2>Acceptable Use</h2>
  <p>
    You agree not to use Chimera for any unlawful, abusive, or disruptive purposes.
    This includes but is not limited to spamming, harassment, exploitation of Discord’s systems,
    or any action that violates the Discord Terms of Service.
  </p>

  <h2>Disclaimer of Warranty</h2>

    regarding uptime, reliability, or suitability for a particular purpose.

    or inability to use Chimera, whether official or self-hosted instances.
